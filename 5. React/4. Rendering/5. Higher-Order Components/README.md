# Higher-Order Components (HOCs) in React

---

## Introduction

Higher-Order Components (HOCs) are a powerful pattern in React for reusing component logic. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. This pattern allows for the abstraction of common functionality into reusable components.

---

## What Is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with enhanced functionality. It allows you to abstract and share component logic across multiple components without duplicating code.

---

### 1. Definition

```javascript
const withExtraInfo = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const extraInfo = "This is additional info";
    return <WrappedComponent {...props} extraInfo={extraInfo} />;
  };
};
```

In this example, `withExtraInfo` is an HOC that adds an `extraInfo` prop to the `WrappedComponent`.

---

### 2. Usage

To use an HOC, wrap your component with the HOC function:

```javascript
import React from "react";

const BasicComponent = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{props.extraInfo}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

const EnhancedComponent = withExtraInfo(BasicComponent);

function App() {
  return <EnhancedComponent />;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- `BasicComponent` is the original component.
- `EnhancedComponent` is the component returned by the `withExtraInfo` HOC, which includes the additional extraInfo prop.

---

## Common Use Cases for HOCs

### 1. Code Reusability

HOCs help in reusing common logic across different components. For example, you might use an HOC to add authentication checks to multiple components.

### 2. Component Enhancements

You can use HOCs to enhance a component with additional props, state, or behavior, such as adding logging, data fetching, or other side effects.

### 3. Conditional Rendering

HOCs can conditionally render components based on certain criteria, such as user permissions or feature flags.

#### Example: Conditional Rendering with HOCs

```javascript
import React from "react";

const withAuthorization = (WrappedComponent) => {
  return (props) => {
    const isAuthorized = true; // Replace with actual authorization logic

    if (!isAuthorized) {
      return <p>Access denied</p>;
    }

    return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
  };
};

const SecretComponent = () => <p>Secret Content</p>;

const AuthorizedComponent = withAuthorization(SecretComponent);

function App() {
  return <AuthorizedComponent />;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- `withAuthorization` HOC checks authorization before rendering the `SecretComponent`.

## Key Points to Consider

#### 1. HOCs Do Not Modify the Original Component

- HOCs return a new component, leaving the original component unchanged. This ensures that the original component remains pure and reusable.

#### 2. HOCs Are Pure Functions

- An HOC should be a pure function, meaning it should not modify the input component or cause side effects.

#### 3. Avoid Overusing HOCs

- While HOCs are powerful, overusing them can lead to a complex component tree and make debugging difficult. Use HOCs when they provide clear benefits and consider other patterns such as hooks for simpler cases.

#### 4. HOCs and Props

- HOCs can add, modify, or remove props from the wrapped component. Be cautious with prop names to avoid conflicts.

## Questions

1. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React?

   - A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior, allowing for the reuse of component logic.

2. How do you create and use an HOC?

   - Create an HOC by defining a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Use the HOC by wrapping your component with it to enhance its functionality.

3. What are some common use cases for HOCs?

   - Common use cases include code reusability, component enhancements, and conditional rendering based on certain criteria.

4. What should you be cautious about when using HOCs?

   - Avoid modifying the original component, ensure the HOC is a pure function, avoid overusing HOCs, and be mindful of prop conflicts.

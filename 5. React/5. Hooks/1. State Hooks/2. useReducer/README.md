# useReducer Hook

---

## Introduction

The useReducer hook is used for managing state in React functional components with more complex state logic. It is often used as an alternative to useState when dealing with multiple state variables or complex state transitions. useReducer provides a way to manage state using a reducer function, similar to how Redux manages state.

### Syntax

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState, init);
```

### Parameters

1. **`reducer`**: A function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state. It is used to describe how the state should change in response to an action.

2. **`initialState`**: The initial state value. It can be of any type, such as an object, array, or primitive value.

3. **`init (optional)`**: A function to lazily initialize the state. This is used only if the initial state is computed. If not provided, initialState is used directly.

## Example

Here’s an example demonstrating the use of the useReducer hook for managing a counter:

```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

// Reducer function
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unknown action type");
  }
};

function Counter() {
  // Initialize state and reducer
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## Key Points

### 1. Reducer Function:

The reducer function takes the current state and an action object as arguments and returns a new state.
Actions are plain objects with a type property and optional additional data.

```javascript
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "actionType":
      return { ...state, value: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

### 2. Dispatch Function:

- `dispatch` is a function that sends actions to the reducer to update the state.
- Actions are typically objects with a type property and any additional data needed.

### 3. Initialization Function:

- The optional `init` function is used to initialize the state lazily. It’s useful for complex initial state logic.

```javascript
const init = (initialState) => ({ count: initialState.count });
```

### 4. State Management:

`useReducer` is ideal for scenarios where state transitions are complex or when managing multiple pieces of state with interdependencies.
It provides a predictable way to manage state with a single function (the reducer) handling state transitions.

### 5. Comparison with useState:

- While `useState` is simpler and suitable for managing local component state, useReducer is better suited for more complex state logic or when state transitions depend on previous state.

## Common Use Cases

- **Form Handling**: Managing form state with multiple fields and validation.
- **Complex State Logic**: Handling complex state transitions and multiple actions.
- **Multiple State Variables**: When managing several related state variables that affect each other.

## Example: Complex Form Handling with useReducer

### Setup the Reducer:

```jsx
import React, { useReducer } from "react";

// Initial state for the form
const initialState = {
  name: "",
  email: "",
  password: "",
  confirmPassword: "",
  agreeToTerms: false,
  gender: "",
  errors: {
    name: "",
    email: "",
    password: "",
    confirmPassword: "",
    agreeToTerms: "",
  },
};

// Actions
const ACTIONS = {
  UPDATE_FIELD: "UPDATE_FIELD",
  VALIDATE_FORM: "VALIDATE_FORM",
  SUBMIT_FORM: "SUBMIT_FORM",
};

// Reducer function
const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ACTIONS.UPDATE_FIELD:
      return {
        ...state,
        [action.field]: action.value,
      };
    case ACTIONS.VALIDATE_FORM:
      const errors = {};
      if (!state.name) errors.name = "Name is required";
      if (!state.email.includes("@")) errors.email = "Invalid email address";
      if (state.password.length < 6)
        errors.password = "Password must be at least 6 characters";
      if (state.password !== state.confirmPassword)
        errors.confirmPassword = "Passwords do not match";
      if (!state.agreeToTerms)
        errors.agreeToTerms = "You must agree to the terms";

      return {
        ...state,
        errors,
      };
    case ACTIONS.SUBMIT_FORM:
      // Handle form submission
      console.log("Form submitted:", state);
      return state;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default function ComplexForm() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value, type, checked } = e.target;
    dispatch({
      type: ACTIONS.UPDATE_FIELD,
      field: name,
      value: type === "checkbox" ? checked : value,
    });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    dispatch({ type: ACTIONS.VALIDATE_FORM });
    if (Object.values(state.errors).every((error) => error === "")) {
      dispatch({ type: ACTIONS.SUBMIT_FORM });
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label>Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          value={state.name}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        {state.errors.name && <p className="error">{state.errors.name}</p>}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          name="email"
          value={state.email}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        {state.errors.email && <p className="error">{state.errors.email}</p>}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Password:</label>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="password"
          value={state.password}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        {state.errors.password && (
          <p className="error">{state.errors.password}</p>
        )}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Confirm Password:</label>
        <input
          type="password"
          name="confirmPassword"
          value={state.confirmPassword}
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        {state.errors.confirmPassword && (
          <p className="error">{state.errors.confirmPassword}</p>
        )}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>
          <input
            type="checkbox"
            name="agreeToTerms"
            checked={state.agreeToTerms}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
          Agree to Terms
        </label>
        {state.errors.agreeToTerms && (
          <p className="error">{state.errors.agreeToTerms}</p>
        )}
      </div>

      <div>
        <label>Gender:</label>
        <select name="gender" value={state.gender} onChange={handleChange}>
          <option value="">Select Gender</option>
          <option value="male">Male</option>
          <option value="female">Female</option>
          <option value="other">Other</option>
        </select>
      </div>

      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Explanation:

- **State and Actions**: The initialState contains form fields and an errors object to keep track of validation errors. The reducer handles field updates, form validation, and submission.

- **Reducer Function**: The reducer updates the state based on action types. It validates form fields and sets error messages accordingly. On form submission, it logs the form data.

- **Handle Change**: The handleChange function updates the form state and handles different input types, including checkboxes.

- **Handle Submit**: The handleSubmit function prevents the default form submission, dispatches a validation action, and submits the form if there are no validation errors.

## Questions

1. What is a reducer function and what role does it play in useReducer?

   - The reducer function is responsible for determining how the state changes in response to actions. It takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.

2. How does dispatch work in useReducer?

   - dispatch sends an action object to the reducer function, which then processes the action and updates the state accordingly.

3. When should you use useReducer instead of useState?

   - Use useReducer for managing complex state logic, multiple state variables, or scenarios where actions have complex transitions. For simpler state needs, useState is often sufficient.

4. What is the purpose of the init function in useReducer?

   - The init function allows for lazy initialization of the state, useful for computations or transformations needed to derive the initial state.

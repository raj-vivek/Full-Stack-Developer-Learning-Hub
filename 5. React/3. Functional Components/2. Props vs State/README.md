# Props vs State in React

---

## Introduction

In React, **props** and **state** are two important concepts used for managing data in components. While both hold information that influences how components behave and render, they serve different purposes and are used in different scenarios.

- **Props** (short for "properties") are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
- **State** is used to manage the internal data of a component and can be modified within the component itself.

Understanding the differences between props and state is essential to mastering React and building dynamic, reusable components.

## Key Concepts

---

### 1. What Are Props?

**Props** are short for "properties" and are read-only data passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow components to be reused with different data, making them highly flexible. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed by the child component receiving them.

#### How Props Work:

- **Parent-to-Child Data Flow**: Props are passed down from parent components to child components.
- **Immutable**: The child component cannot modify the props it receives.
- **Used for Reusability**: Components can be reused by passing different props.

#### Example of Props:

```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="Alice" />
      <Greeting name="Bob" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- The `Greeting` component is a child component that receives name as a prop.
- The `App` component passes the name prop with different values (Alice and Bob) to create reusable greetings.

---

### 2. What is State?

**State** is a data structure that holds dynamic information about a component. Unlike props, state is mutable, meaning it can change over time and influence how the component behaves and renders. State is internal to the component and cannot be accessed or modified by other components (unless passed via props).

- **Owned by the Component**: State is managed within the component itself.
- **Mutable**: State can change, and when it does, the component re-renders.
- **Used for Interactivity**: State is often used to handle user interactions, such as form inputs, button clicks, and data fetching.

#### Example of State (using useState):

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initialize state with 0

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:

- The `Counter` component uses the `useState` hook to manage its state.
- The state variable `count` starts at 0, and `setCount` is used to update it.
- Clicking the button updates the state and causes the component to re-render with the new `count`.

### 3. Differences Between Props and State

Though both props and state hold data that affects how a component renders, they have distinct differences in how they work and when they should be used.

| Feature                 | Props                                      | State                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**          | Data passed from parent to child           | Internal data managed by the component                           |
| **Mutability**          | Immutable (read-only)                      | Mutable (can be updated)                                         |
| **Ownership**           | Owned by parent, passed to child           | Owned by the component itself                                    |
| **Updates**             | Cannot be updated by child                 | Can be updated using `setState` (class) or `useState` (function) |
| **Reusability**         | Allows component reuse with different data | Manages dynamic behavior within a component                      |
| **Usage**               | Used for passing static data and callbacks | Used for handling dynamic, interactive data                      |
| **Can Be Passed Down?** | Yes (passed from parent to child)          | No (local to the component)                                      |

### 4. When to Use Props vs State

#### Use Props When:

- You want to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
- The data does not change and should be immutable from the perspective of the child.
- You want to handle callbacks, like passing event handlers to child components.

#### Use State When:

- You need to manage dynamic data within a component.
- The data changes over time based on user interaction or external events.
- You want to trigger re-renders when the data changes.

---

### 5. Using Props and State Together

Props and state often work together to build dynamic UIs. You might use state to store internal data within a component, and pass that data as props to child components.

#### Example of Combining Props and State:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function UserProfile(props) {
  return <h1>User: {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Alice");

  return (
    <div>
      <UserProfile name={name} />
      <button onClick={() => setName("Bob")}>Change Name</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- The `App` component manages the `name` state using `useState`.
- The `name` state is passed as a prop to the `UserProfile` component.
- Clicking the button updates the `name` state, which causes both `App` and `UserProfile` to re-render with the new `name`.

---

### 6. Passing State as Props

Sometimes, state from a parent component is passed down to a child component via props. This allows the child component to render dynamic data based on the parent’s state.

Example:

```javascript
function Display(props) {
  return <h2>The count is: {props.count}</h2>;
}

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <Display count={count} />
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

In this example:

- The Counter component manages the state variable count.
- The count state is passed as a prop to the Display component.
- The Display component renders the current count, which updates every time the button is clicked.

---

### 7. Prop Drilling and State Lifting

#### Prop Drilling

When props need to be passed down through multiple layers of components, it is known as prop drilling. While props are necessary for passing data, prop drilling can sometimes make the code harder to maintain, especially in deeply nested component trees.

##### Example of Prop Drilling:

```javascript
function Grandchild({ name }) {
  return <p>Grandchild's name: {name}</p>;
}

function Child({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Grandchild name={name} />
    </div>
  );
}

function Parent() {
  const name = "Alice";
  return <Child name={name} />;
}

function App() {
  return <Parent />;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

- The `name` prop is passed from the `Parent` component to the `Child` component, and then to the Grandchild component.
- This is prop drilling: the `Child` component doesn’t actually need the `name` prop, but it passes it down to the Grandchild component.

#### State Lifting

When two or more components need to share state, it’s often best to lift the state up to their closest common ancestor and pass it down as props.

##### Example of State Lifting:

```javascript
function TemperatureInput({ temperature, onTemperatureChange }) {
  return (
    <input
      type="text"
      value={temperature}
      onChange={(e) => onTemperatureChange(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}

function TemperatureConverter() {
  const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState("");

  return (
    <div>
      <TemperatureInput
        temperature={temperature}
        onTemperatureChange={setTemperature}
      />
      <p>The temperature is {temperature}°C</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default TemperatureConverter;
```

In this example:

- The `TemperatureConverter` component manages the `temperature` state.
- The state is passed as a prop to the `TemperatureInput` component, which handles the input and triggers state changes via the `onTemperatureChange` callback.
- The `TemperatureConverter` component lifts the state and controls both the input field and the display text.

---

### 8. Common Pitfalls

#### 1. Avoid Misusing State for Static Data

- If the data is not going to change, use props instead of state. Storing static data in state can lead to unnecessary re-renders.

#### 2. Do Not Mutate State Directly

- Always use the `setState` function (or `setCount`, `setValue` in functional components) to update state. Mutating state directly can lead to unexpected behavior and will not trigger a re-render.

#### Incorrect:

```javascript
this.state.count = this.state.count + 1; // Don't mutate state directly
```

#### Correct:

```javascript
this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); // Correct way to update state
```

## Questions

1. What is the difference between props and state in React?

   - Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components and are immutable, while state is internal to the component and can be changed using setState or useState.

2. Can a child component modify its props?

   - No, props are read-only in the child component. If you want to modify data passed via props, the parent component must manage the state and pass it down as props.

3. When should you use state in a React component?

   - State should be used when you need to manage data that can change over time, such as user input, fetched data, or dynamic UI elements.

4. What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?

5. When should you use props instead of state?

   - Props should be used when you need to pass static or read-only data from a parent component to its children.

## Conclusion
Understanding the difference between props and state is fundamental to building interactive React applications. Props allow for the flow of data between components, while state enables components to manage their own dynamic data. By using props and state effectively, developers can build modular, reusable, and responsive user interfaces in React.

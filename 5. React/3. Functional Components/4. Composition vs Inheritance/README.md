# Composition vs Inheritance in React

## Introduction

In React, **composition** and **inheritance** are two approaches used to structure and reuse components. React favors **composition** as the primary mechanism for code reuse and component organization, while **inheritance** is rarely used.

Composition allows you to build complex UIs from simpler, smaller components by combining them in various ways, creating a flexible and maintainable component structure. In contrast, inheritance involves extending components, similar to object-oriented programming (OOP), but this approach is not recommended in React due to the component-based nature of the library.

## Key Concepts

---

### 1. Composition in React

**Composition** refers to the process of combining multiple components to form a new component or a more complex UI. This approach is powerful because it promotes reusability and a clean, modular architecture. By using composition, you can pass components as children, use them as props, or nest components inside one another.

React embraces composition over inheritance, encouraging you to build UIs from components that can be combined in flexible ways.

#### Example of Composition:

```javascript
function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome to our website!</h1>;
}

function Footer() {
  return <footer>© 2024 My Website</footer>;
}

function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Page;
```

In this example:

- The `Page` component is composed of two other components: `Welcome` and `Footer`.
- This is a basic example of composition, where components are combined to form a larger structure.

### 2. Children Prop for Composition

One of the most common patterns in React composition is using the children prop. This allows you to pass components or elements as children to a parent component. The parent component can render its children anywhere in its JSX.

Example:

```javascript
function Card(props) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <div>{props.children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Card title="Card Title">
      <p>This is the content inside the card.</p>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- The `Card` component accepts a `title` prop and uses the `children` prop to display whatever is passed between the opening and closing tags of the `Card` component.
- The `children` prop makes it easy to nest elements or components inside a parent component, promoting reusable and flexible layouts.

---

### 3. Specialization through Composition

Composition allows you to create "specialized" components by composing them from more generic ones. This technique is useful when building components that share common functionality but have different appearances or behaviors.

Example of Specialization:

```javascript
function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    <div className="dialog">
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>{props.message}</p>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}

function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog title="Welcome" message="Thank you for visiting our website!">
      <button>OK</button>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- The `Dialog` component is a reusable, generic component.
- The `WelcomeDialog` component specializes the Dialog by passing specific props and adding a button using composition.

### 4. Inheritance in React (Discouraged)

- Inheritance is a common pattern in object-oriented programming (OOP) where one class extends another to share functionality. However, React encourages composition over inheritance because the component model doesn't naturally fit with classical inheritance patterns.

- In React, inheritance can introduce complexity and tight coupling between components, making the code harder to maintain and scale. Instead of extending components via inheritance, React recommends solving similar problems using composition.

Why Inheritance is Discouraged:

1. **Tight Coupling**: Inheritance creates tightly coupled components, meaning changes in the parent class can unintentionally affect child components, making it difficult to reason about and maintain the application.
2. **Reduced Reusability**: Inheritance often leads to less flexible components that are harder to reuse in different contexts, as they depend on the structure and behavior of the parent class.
3. **Component Complexity**: React's component-based architecture is already highly composable, and introducing inheritance adds unnecessary complexity that composition can solve more elegantly.

#### Example of Inheritance (Discouraged):

```javascript
class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <button>{this.props.label}</button>;
  }
}

class SubmitButton extends Button {
  render() {
    return <button type="submit">{this.props.label}</button>;
  }
}
```

In this example:

1. The `SubmitButton` class inherits from the `Button` class and overrides the render method to change the button type.
2. While inheritance works, it’s not the preferred approach in React. Using composition would be more flexible and maintainable.

### 5. Solving Problems with Composition (Instead of Inheritance)

Many of the problems that developers try to solve with inheritance in React can be handled more effectively using composition. For example, instead of extending a base component, you can create small, composable components that can be combined to form more complex UIs.

### Example: Replacing Inheritance with Composition

Instead of using inheritance to create a `SubmitButton`, we can pass the `type` prop to a more generic Button component:

```javascript
function Button(props) {
  return <button type={props.type}>{props.label}</button>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button type="button" label="Click Me" />
      <Button type="submit" label="Submit" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example:

- The Button component is a generic button, and its behavior is customized by passing props like type.
- This solution is more flexible and maintainable than inheritance, as it promotes reusability without tight coupling.

## Key Differences Between Composition and Inheritance

| Feature                   | Composition                                                    | Inheritance                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flexibility**           | High: Components are combined as needed                        | Low: Tightly coupled parent-child relationship                      |
| **Component Reusability** | High: Components are more reusable                             | Lower: Child components are tied to parent components               |
| **Encapsulation**         | Encourages loose coupling and better encapsulation             | Increases coupling between components                               |
| **Primary Use Case**      | React's recommended approach to reuse and structure components | Rarely used in React due to complexity                              |
| **Approach**              | Components are composed using props and children               | Child components extend and inherit behavior from parent components |

## When to Use Composition vs Inheritance

### Use Composition When:

1. You need to build reusable components that can be combined and customized for different use cases.
2. You want to separate concerns and keep components decoupled.
3. You need flexibility in passing children or customizing components via props.
4. You want to avoid tight coupling and increase maintainability.

### Avoid Inheritance:

- Do not try to extend component behavior, as this can lead to more tightly coupled code.
- The functionality can be achieved using composition, which is more flexible and fits React's architecture better.

# React Redux and Redux Toolkit

## 1. Introduction to Redux

**Redux** is a state management library that helps manage the state of your application in a predictable and centralized manner. It is often used in larger applications where managing state across many components becomes complex.

- It provides a central store where all the application states are kept, making it easier to manage, debug, and maintain state across the app.

## Core Concepts of Redux

### 1. **State**:

- The single source of truth for the applicationâ€™s state.

### 3. **Actions**

- Plain JavaScript objects that describe the intention of changing the state.
- Each action has a `type` and optionally additional data (payload).

### 4. **Reducers**

- Pure functions that take the current state and an action, then return the new state.
- The reducer specifies how the state changes in response to an action.

### 2. **Store**

- The object that brings the state, actions, and reducers together. It holds the application state.
- The single source of truth where the entire state of the application is stored.
- Each app can only have one store.

### 5. **Dispatch**

- A method to send an action to the Redux store, which triggers the reducer and updates the state.

### 6. **Selectors**

- Functions that read or compute derived data from the Redux store.

## 2. What is React Redux?

**React Redux** is the official Redux binding for React. It helps React components interact with the Redux store, allowing them to access state and dispatch actions.

### Benefits of React Redux:

- **Easy Access to Global State**: React components can easily access and update the global state stored in Redux.
- **Performance Optimization**: React Redux minimizes unnecessary re-renders by connecting components only to the part of the state they need.
- **Predictability**: Redux ensures state changes happen in a predictable and structured way.

## 3. Introducing Redux Toolkit

**Redux Toolkit** is the recommended way to write Redux logic. It reduces boilerplate and simplifies common tasks like store setup, action creation, and reducers.

### Key Features of Redux Toolkit:

- **`configureStore()`**: Sets up the Redux store with good defaults, including middleware like `redux-thunk`.
- **`createSlice()`**: Automatically generates action creators and reducers for a piece of the Redux state.
- **`createAsyncThunk()`**: Handles async actions like API calls, including dispatching of pending, fulfilled, and rejected states.
- **`createSelector()`**: Optimizes derived data selection from the Redux store.

## 4. Setting Up React Redux and Redux Toolkit

### a. Installing Dependencies

You need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### b. Creating a Redux Store

In Redux Toolkit, the configureStore() function sets up the store with good defaults, including Redux middleware.

```javascript
// store.js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

### c. Defining a Slice

A slice represents a part of your Redux state and includes the reducer logic and actions. The createSlice() function is used to simplify this process.

```javascript
// counterSlice.js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

### d. Providing the Store to React

Use the Provider component from React Redux to make the store available to your React app.

```javascript
// index.js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### e. Connecting React Components to Redux Store

Use the useSelector and useDispatch hooks from React Redux to interact with the Redux store in your components.

```javascript
// CounterComponent.js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } from "./counterSlice";

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(incrementByAmount(5))}>
        Increment by 5
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

5. Async Actions with createAsyncThunk()
   For handling asynchronous logic like fetching data from an API, you can use createAsyncThunk().

```javascript
// postsSlice.js
import { createSlice, createAsyncThunk } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

// Async action to fetch posts
export const fetchPosts = createAsyncThunk("posts/fetchPosts", async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/posts");
  return response.json();
});

const postsSlice = createSlice({
  name: "posts",
  initialState: { posts: [], status: "idle", error: null },
  reducers: {},
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchPosts.pending, (state) => {
        state.status = "loading";
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "succeeded";
        state.posts = action.payload;
      })
      .addCase(fetchPosts.rejected, (state, action) => {
        state.status = "failed";
        state.error = action.error.message;
      });
  },
});

export default postsSlice.reducer;
```

## 6. Best Practices with Redux Toolkit

1. **Use createSlice()**: Avoid manually writing action creators and reducers. Let Redux Toolkit generate them.
2. **Keep reducers pure**: Reducers should not cause side effects (like API calls).
3. **Normalize State**: Keep your Redux state flat and normalized for efficiency.
4. **Use createAsyncThunk() for Async Logic**: Simplifies handling of async actions like API requests and ensures clean separation of concerns.
5. **Use useSelector for Reading State**: Access the global state in your components using the useSelector hook.
6. **Use useDispatch for Actions**: Dispatch actions from components with the useDispatch hook.

## 7. Conclusion

By using React Redux and the Redux Toolkit, state management in React becomes more structured, concise, and predictable. Redux Toolkit provides built-in utilities that reduce boilerplate code and simplify common patterns like handling async actions and working with reducers.

The integration of Redux Toolkit into a modern React application allows for:

- Efficient handling of state across complex applications.
- Simplified state logic with createSlice() and createAsyncThunk().
- Predictable state updates that make debugging and testing easier.

## Best Practices

1. Keep Reducers Pure: Reducers should only calculate the next state based on the current state and the action. Avoid side effects like API calls in reducers.
2. Normalize State Shape: Store data in a normalized format, avoiding deeply nested structures.
   Use combineReducers: Split large reducers into smaller, more manageable ones, and combine them using combineReducers.
3. Avoid Overusing Redux: Not every piece of state needs to be in Redux. Local UI state (e.g., form input values) can stay in React component state.

## Summary

Redux provides a way to manage the global state of an application in a predictable and maintainable way. It emphasizes a unidirectional data flow, making debugging and understanding application behavior easier.

1. **Store**: Holds the application's state.
2. **Actions**: Describe the type of state changes.
3. **Reducers**: Pure functions that compute the new state.
4. **Middlewares**: Enhance Redux with custom behavior (e.g., async actions).
5. **React-Redux**: Connects Redux to React components via hooks like `useSelector` and `useDispatch`.

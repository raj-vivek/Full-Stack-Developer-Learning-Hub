# JPA vs Spring Data JPA

Spring Data JPA builds on top of JPA and provides additional features to simplify working with JPA. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of JPA features versus Spring Data JPA features:

### JPA Features

1. Entity Management

   - EntityManager: Core interface for managing entities and interacting with the persistence context.
   - EntityManagerFactory: Creates EntityManager instances.
   - Entity: Annotated class representing a database table.

2. Persistence Context

   - Persistence Context: Manages the lifecycle of entities and their state transitions.

3. Query Language

   - JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language): Query language for querying entities using object-oriented syntax.
   - Criteria API: A type-safe way to create dynamic queries.
   - JPQL is used and since it is platform-independent, we no need to depend on any native SQL table. Complex expressions and filtering expressions are all handled via JPQL only.

4. Transactions

   - Transaction Management: JPA supports both container-managed and application-managed transactions.

5. Caching

   - First-Level Cache: Automatically provided by the EntityManager for the duration of a transaction.
   - Second-Level Cache: Optional and can be configured with providers like Ehcache.

6. Mapping Annotations

   - @Table, @Column, @Id, etc.: Annotations to define the mapping between entities and database tables.

### Spring Data JPA Features

1. Repository Abstraction

   - JpaRepository: Provides a higher-level abstraction over EntityManager, offering built-in methods for common operations (e.g., save, findAll, delete).
   - Custom Repository Methods: Allows defining custom query methods based on method names or JPQL queries.

2. Query Creation

   - Derived Queries: Automatically generates queries based on the method names in the repository interface.
   - @Query Annotation: Defines custom JPQL or native SQL queries within repository interfaces.

3. Pagination and Sorting

   - PagingAndSortingRepository: Provides methods for pagination and sorting, built on top of JpaRepository.

4. Auditing

   - Entity Auditing: Automatic tracking of entity creation and modification timestamps.

5. Dynamic Querying

   - Specifications and QueryDSL: Provides a way to create dynamic queries using specifications or QueryDSL (optional).

6. Repository Configuration

   - Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures the repository beans and integrates with Spring Boot.

7. Integration with Spring

   - Spring Context Integration: Repository beans are managed by the Spring container, benefiting from dependency injection, transaction management, and more.

### Interaction Between JPA and Spring Data JPA

- JPA Core Features: Provide the fundamental mechanisms for entity management, persistence, and querying.
- Spring Data JPA Abstractions: Simplify and enhance these mechanisms by providing higher-level abstractions, automatic query generation, and integration with the Spring framework.

### Summary
JPA provides the low-level API for managing entities and persistence, including EntityManager and query capabilities. Spring Data JPA abstracts over JPA, simplifying its usage by providing repositories with pre-defined methods, automatic query creation, and integration with the broader Spring ecosystem. This abstraction reduces boilerplate code and simplifies interactions with the persistence layer.

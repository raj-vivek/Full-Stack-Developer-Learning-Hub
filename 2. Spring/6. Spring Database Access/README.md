# Spring Database Access

## Overview

- Spring provides a set of tools and abstractions for managing data access and persistence in Spring applications.
- This includes integration with various data access technologies, simplifying database operations, and abstracting away boilerplate code.
- Key components include Hibernate and Spring Data JPA.

## Key Components

### 1. JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

**JDBC** is the foundational API for connecting and executing SQL queries directly on databases in Java. It provides a set of interfaces to interact with relational databases but requires a lot of boilerplate code, such as creating connections, managing transactions, and handling result sets manually.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Connection**: Establishes a connection with the database.
- **Statement**: Used to execute SQL queries.
- **ResultSet**: Used to process the data retrieved from the database.

#### JDBC Example

This is a basic, low-level way of accessing a database in Java using SQL queries. In Spring, we can use `JdbcTemplate` to simplify JDBC operations.

```java
// JdbcTemplateExample.java
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.RowMapper;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.util.List;

@Repository
public class UserJdbcRepository {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    private static final String FIND_ALL_QUERY = "SELECT * FROM users";

    public List<User> findAllUsers() {
        return jdbcTemplate.query(FIND_ALL_QUERY, new UserRowMapper());
    }

    private static class UserRowMapper implements RowMapper<User> {
        @Override
        public User mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
            User user = new User();
            user.setId(rs.getLong("id"));
            user.setName(rs.getString("name"));
            user.setEmail(rs.getString("email"));
            return user;
        }
    }
}
```

### Issues with JDBC:

- Extensive boilerplate code for connection management.
- Manual transaction handling.
- Tight coupling between Java code and SQL queries.
- No abstraction for handling domain models (entities).

---

### 2. ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

**ORM** is a design pattern that automatically maps Java objects to database tables. It abstracts the database interactions, allowing developers to work with objects rather than raw SQL queries.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Entities**: Java classes that map to database tables.
- **Session/Entity Manager**: Responsible for interacting with the database via entities.
- **Mappings**: Define the relationships between Java classes and database tables.

#### Improvements over JDBC:

- Reduces boilerplate code by abstracting SQL queries.
- Provides automatic mapping between objects and database records.
- Supports object-oriented features like inheritance and relationships.

However, ORM tools can still be complex, and managing sessions, transactions, and lazy loading requires careful handling.

---

### 3. Hibernate

- **Hibernate** is a popular ORM framework in Java that implements the ORM pattern.
- It allows developers to map Java objects (entities) to relational database tables, significantly reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to manage database interactions.
- Hibernate abstracts JDBC and automates the persistence of objects, reducing the need to write manual SQL queries.

#### Key Concepts:

- **SessionFactory**: A thread-safe object used to create sessions. It is responsible for establishing database connections and managing the lifecycle of persistent objects.
- **Session**: Represents a single interaction between the application and the database. It is used to perform CRUD operations on entities.
- **Transactions**: Hibernate allows you to manage database transactions programmatically. It supports both declarative and programmatic transaction handling.
- **Lazy vs Eager Loading**: Lazy loading defers the loading of related entities until they are needed, while eager loading retrieves all related entities immediately.
- **Entity Lifecycle**: Hibernate manages the lifecycle of entities: transient (newly created), persistent (managed by Hibernate), detached (disconnected from Hibernate session), and removed (marked for deletion).
- **EntityManager**: In Hibernate, the `EntityManager` is responsible for the life cycle of entities.

#### Core functionalities:

- Hibernate provides features like automatic table generation, lazy loading, caching, and transaction management.
- Developers manage transactions manually using `Session` and `Transaction` objects.
- Direct access to the Hibernate API like `SessionFactory`, `Session`, and `Query`.

#### Improvements:

- Hibernate solves many problems of manual ORM by providing a more powerful query language (HQL) and automating many tasks such as entity lifecycle management, caching, and relationship handling.
- Introduces automatic dirty checking, which tracks changes to entities and automatically synchronizes them with the database.

#### Example: Pure Hibernate Usage

```java
public class HibernateUserRepository {
    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    public HibernateUserRepository() {
        sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
    }

    public void saveUser(User user) {
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        session.beginTransaction();
        session.save(user);
        session.getTransaction().commit();
        session.close();
    }

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        User user = session.get(User.class, id);
        session.close();
        return user;
    }
}
```

### 4. Spring Hibernate

#### Description:

Spring Hibernate refers to the integration of Hibernate with the Spring Framework. While Hibernate on its own can manage database interactions, Spring simplifies this process by handling configurations, dependency injection, and transaction management. By integrating Hibernate with Spring, you can avoid manual handling of SessionFactory and transactions and take advantage of Spring’s declarative transaction management.

#### Key Concepts:

- **SessionFactory**: In Spring Hibernate, `SessionFactory` is managed as a Spring bean and injected where needed, reducing boilerplate code.
- **@Transactional**: Spring’s `@Transactional` annotation simplifies transaction management, eliminating the need to manually start and commit transactions.
- **Session Management**: Spring manages Session objects automatically, usually obtaining them through `sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()`.

#### Improvements with Spring Hibernate:

- **Declarative Transaction Management**: Spring handles transactions automatically with `@Transactional`, making the code cleaner and reducing the chance of errors.
- **Integration with Spring Beans**: `SessionFactory` and `Session` are injected into repositories as beans, supporting Spring's dependency injection model.
- **Less Boilerplate Code**: Spring abstracts the configuration of Hibernate, eliminating the need to write Hibernate configuration manually.

#### Example: Spring Hibernate Usage

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepository {

    @Autowired
    private SessionFactory sessionFactory;

    @Transactional
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
        session.save(user);
    }

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        Session session = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
        return session.get(User.class, id);
    }
}
```

#### Key Differences Between Hibernate and Spring Hibernate:

1. Configuration:

- Hibernate: Requires manual configuration of `SessionFactory` and `transactions`.
- Spring Hibernate: Spring simplifies this through dependency injection and annotation-driven transaction management.

2. Transaction Management:

- Hibernate: Transactions are handled manually with `session.beginTransaction()` and session.`getTransaction().commit()`.
- Spring Hibernate: Transactions are managed using @Transactional, allowing declarative transaction control.

<!--
### Steps:

1. Include Dependencies: Add necessary dependencies to your pom.xml or build.gradle file.

   - For eg:
     1. Spring Data JPA
     2. MySQL Driver

2. Configure Data Source: Set up your database connection properties in application.properties or application.yml.
3. Create Entities and Repositories: Define your JPA entities and repositories for data access.
4. Use Services: Implement your business logic and interact with the data access layer. -->

## 4. JPA (Java Persistence API)

**JPA** is a specification for ORM frameworks like Hibernate. It standardizes ORM-based database access in Java, allowing developers to switch between different implementations (e.g., Hibernate, EclipseLink) without changing their code.

### Key Concepts:

- **EntityManagerFactory**: Responsible for creating and managing instances of EntityManager.
- **EntityManager**: Provided by JPA, manages the lifecycle of entities, including persisting, updating, and deleting them.
- **Persistence Context**: The set of entity instances managed by an `EntityManager`.
- **JPQL**: Java Persistence Query Language, a standardized query language for querying entities.

### Improvements:

- JPA is a standard, allowing developers to use any ORM framework that follows the JPA specification (like Hibernate, EclipseLink).
- Supports the use of annotations for defining entity mappings (e.g., `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, etc.).

---

## 5. Spring Data JPA

**Spring Data JPA** builds on top of JPA and provides an even higher level of abstraction. It integrates JPA with the Spring ecosystem and simplifies repository creation and query execution. The goal of Spring Data JPA is to reduce boilerplate code further and enable the rapid development of data access layers.

### Key Concepts:

- **JpaRepository**: A Spring Data interface that provides generic CRUD operations without writing any SQL.
- **Derived Queries**: Automatically generates queries from method names (e.g., `findByLastName(String lastName)`).
- **Custom Queries**: You can still use custom JPQL queries with `@Query`.
- **Transaction Management**: Automatic transaction management with annotations like `@Transactional`.

### Improvements:

- **Automatic Repository Creation**: Spring Data JPA automatically provides repository implementations, requiring only the entity class and repository interface.
- **Pagination and Sorting**: Provides built-in support for pagination and sorting of results.
- **Query Methods**: You can define methods like `findByUsername` in your repository interface, and Spring Data JPA automatically generates the appropriate SQL queries.

---

## Additional Key Components

### DataSource

A **DataSource** is a factory for database connections. It simplifies the task of obtaining a connection to the database. In Spring, `DataSource` can be automatically configured and pooled for performance optimization (e.g., using HikariCP).

### EntityManager

In both Hibernate and JPA, the **EntityManager** is the core component responsible for managing the lifecycle of entities. It interacts with the database, persists entities, and manages queries and transactions. The `EntityManager` is analogous to the Hibernate `Session`.

### JpaRepository

Provides built-in CRUD operations and query generation based on method names. Part of Spring Data JPA.

---

## Hibernate as both ORM Framework and JPA Implementation

### Hibernate as an ORM Framework

Hibernate is a powerful ORM framework that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables, thus eliminating the need for writing raw SQL. As an ORM framework, Hibernate offers:

1. **Entity Mapping**: Hibernate maps Java objects (called entities) to relational database tables. For example, a User class is mapped to a users table in the database.
2. **Session Management**: Hibernate uses a Session to interact with the database. It handles the lifecycle of entities, manages connections, and synchronizes objects with the database.
3. **Automatic Dirty Checking**: Hibernate tracks changes to objects and automatically synchronizes those changes with the database.
4. **Caching**: Hibernate provides first-level and second-level caching to improve performance by minimizing database access.
5. **HQL (Hibernate Query Language)**: A query language designed specifically for Hibernate, which allows you to query objects rather than writing raw SQL.

### Hibernate as a JPA Implementation:

JPA (Java Persistence API) is a specification that standardizes ORM-based database interaction in Java. Hibernate is one of the most widely used implementations of JPA.

1. **EntityManagerFactory**:

- Responsible for creating and managing instances of EntityManager.
- In Hibernate, when used as a JPA provider, it works similarly to SessionFactory, providing EntityManager instances that manage the lifecycle of entities and perform CRUD operations.

2. **EntityManager**:

- It’s the primary interface for interacting with the persistence context in JPA.
- It performs operations like persisting, finding, removing, and merging entities.
- In Hibernate, when acting as a JPA provider, `EntityManager` is backed by a Hibernate `Session` under the hood.
- Hibernate implements the `EntityManager` interface, which is part of the JPA specification and manages the lifecycle of entities.

2. **JPA Annotations**:

- Hibernate supports all JPA annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, and `@ManyToOne`, etc.

3. **Persistence Unit**:

- In JPA, Hibernate uses the `persistence.xml` configuration file for defining persistence units and integrating with the JPA API.

4. **JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language)**:

- Hibernate supports JPQL, the query language defined by JPA, but it also provides its own HQL. JPQL is a standard query language that works across all JPA implementations.

### EntityManager and EntityManagerFactory in Spring Hibernate

Spring abstracts a lot of the manual configuration, so developers typically interact with JPA's EntityManager interface but rely on Spring for configuration and transaction management.

1. EntityManagerFactory: In a Spring application, EntityManagerFactory is managed by Spring, and you don’t need to manually configure it. Spring will inject it as a bean wherever required.
2. EntityManager: In a Spring Hibernate application, EntityManager is typically injected or created by Spring through dependency injection. You can then use it in your repository to interact with the database.

### Why is Hibernate Both ORM and JPA?

- As an ORM framework, Hibernate predates JPA and was one of the first ORM frameworks in Java.
- When JPA was introduced as a standard specification in Java (starting from Java EE 5), Hibernate adapted itself to implement this specification. This allowed developers to use the standardized JPA API while still leveraging Hibernate's additional features and optimizations.

### Example of Spring Hibernate (JPA) Usage

```java
@Repository
public class UserRepository {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager entityManager;

    @Transactional
    public void saveUser(User user) {
        entityManager.persist(user);
    }

    public User findUserById(Long id) {
        return entityManager.find(User.class, id);
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- **Hibernate as an ORM**: It maps Java objects to relational database tables and provides features like caching, lazy loading, and query optimizations.
- **Hibernate as a JPA Provider**: Hibernate implements the JPA specification, allowing developers to use the standardized JPA API (e.g., EntityManager, JPQL, @Entity) while benefiting from Hibernate’s powerful ORM features.

### How Hibernate Implements Both ORM and JPA:

1. Hibernate as an ORM Framework:

   - Direct ORM: Hibernate provides its own set of APIs and tools for mapping Java objects to database tables. It allows developers to work directly with Hibernate's `SessionFactory`, `Session`, and other features to handle CRUD operations and entity relationships. Also uses `@Entity`, `@Table`, and `@Id`.
   - Features: Hibernate offers advanced features like caching, lazy loading, and custom query languages (HQL) that go beyond the standard ORM capabilities.

2. Hibernate as a JPA Provider:

   - JPA Implementation: Hibernate implements the JPA specification, meaning it provides support for the JPA APIs and adheres to the standards defined by JPA. When you use Hibernate as a JPA provider, you interact with Hibernate through JPA interfaces such as `EntityManager`, `JpaRepository`, and annotations like `@Entity`, `@Table`, and `@Id`.
   - Compatibility: Hibernate allows developers to use JPA APIs while benefiting from Hibernate’s additional features. You can use Hibernate's implementation of JPA to achieve the same goals while leveraging Hibernate’s extended capabilities.

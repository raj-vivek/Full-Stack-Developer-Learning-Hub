# Microservices vs Monolith

## Theory

### Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where an application is built as a single, indivisible unit. All components and functionalities are integrated and interdependent, sharing the same codebase and resources.

#### Characteristics

- **Single Codebase**: All functionalities, including user interfaces, business logic, and data access, are part of a single codebase.
- **Tightly Coupled Components**: Components are closely integrated, making changes and updates challenging.
- **Single Deployment Unit**: The entire application is deployed as a single unit, requiring redeployment for any changes.
- **Scalability**: Scaling a monolithic application often involves scaling the entire application rather than specific components.

#### Use Cases

- **Small to Medium Applications**: Suitable for small to medium-sized applications with limited complexity.
- **Less Complex Requirements**: When the application requirements are straightforward and do not involve high scalability needs.

### Microservices Architecture

Microservices architecture breaks down an application into smaller, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific functionality or business capability. These services communicate through APIs and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#### Characteristics

- **Multiple Services**: The application is divided into multiple services, each handling a specific function or domain.
- **Loosely Coupled**: Services are loosely coupled, allowing independent development, deployment, and scaling.
- **Independent Deployment**: Each microservice can be deployed separately, enabling continuous integration and deployment.
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled independently based on their needs, providing better resource utilization.

#### Use Cases

- **Large and Complex Applications**: Suitable for large applications with complex requirements and high scalability needs.
- **Rapid Development and Deployment**: When frequent updates and deployments are required for different parts of the application.
- **Diverse Technology Stack**: When different services require different technologies or frameworks.

## Comparison

| Aspect                | Monolithic Architecture                             | Microservices Architecture           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Codebase**          | Single, unified codebase                            | Multiple, independent codebases      |
| **Deployment**        | Single deployment unit                              | Multiple independent deployments     |
| **Scaling**           | Scales as a whole                                   | Scales individual services           |
| **Coupling**          | Tightly coupled components                          | Loosely coupled services             |
| **Development Speed** | Slower due to integration and dependency management | Faster due to isolated development   |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | Difficult to isolate failures                       | Easier to isolate failures           |
| **Technology Stack**  | Uniform technology stack                            | Diverse technology stack per service |

## Use Cases

- **Monolithic Architecture**:

  - **Small Applications**: Ideal for applications with limited functionality and less need for scalability.
  - **Simple Deployment**: Suitable for scenarios where deployment complexity is minimal.

- **Microservices Architecture**:
  - **Large Applications**: Ideal for applications with complex and varied requirements that benefit from modularization.
  - **High Scalability**: Suitable for applications requiring dynamic scaling of individual components.
  - **Frequent Updates**: When continuous integration and deployment are essential.

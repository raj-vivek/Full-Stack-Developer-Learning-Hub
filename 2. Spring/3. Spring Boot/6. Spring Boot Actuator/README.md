# Spring Boot Actuator

## Theory

- Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your Spring Boot application.
- It exposes various endpoints to gain insights into the application's health, metrics, environment, and more, which is crucial for maintaining and operating applications in production environments.

### Key Points

1. **What is Spring Boot Actuator?**

   - Actuator is a set of tools and endpoints provided by Spring Boot that allows you to interact with your application to monitor and manage its runtime behavior.

2. **Key Endpoints**:

   - **/actuator/health**: Provides the health status of your application. This endpoint is used to check if the application is up and running.
   - **/actuator/metrics**: Exposes various metrics related to your application's performance and behavior, such as JVM memory usage, garbage collection statistics, and HTTP request statistics.
   - **/actuator/env**: Displays the application's environment properties, including configuration properties and system properties.
   - **/actuator/info**: Shows arbitrary application information, such as build version and custom metadata.
   - **/actuator/auditevents**: Provides audit events generated by the application, useful for security auditing.

3. **Configuration**:

   - Actuator endpoints can be customized and secured using application properties or YAML configuration. You can enable or disable specific endpoints and configure their exposure.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Add `spring-boot-starter-actuator` to your project dependencies to include Actuator support.

### Example

#### `pom.xml` with Actuator

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- Other dependencies -->

    <!-- Spring Boot Actuator -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Configuration Example (application.properties)

```properties
# Enable specific endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,metrics,info

# Secure the actuator endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=env,auditevents
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

### Use Cases

1. Monitoring: Use Actuator to monitor the health and performance metrics of your application in real-time.
2. Management: Manage and configure application behavior through Actuator endpoints.
3. Troubleshooting: Diagnose issues by examining metrics, health status, and application environment details.

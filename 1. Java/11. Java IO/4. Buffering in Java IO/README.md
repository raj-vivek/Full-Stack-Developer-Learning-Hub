# Buffering in Java IO

## Theory

### Overview

Buffering in Java I/O refers to the use of a buffer to temporarily store data while reading from or writing to a file or stream. The primary purpose of buffering is to improve the efficiency of I/O operations by reducing the number of times that the underlying system needs to access the physical disk or network resource.

### Key Concepts

1. **Buffer**:

   - **Definition**: A buffer is a block of memory that holds data temporarily while it's being moved from one place to another. In Java I/O, buffers are used to store data that is read from or written to a stream, reducing the number of I/O operations.

2. **Buffered Streams**:

   - **BufferedInputStream**: This class wraps around an `InputStream` and provides buffering. It reads a larger block of data at once and stores it in an internal buffer, allowing subsequent reads to retrieve data from the buffer instead of the disk.
   - **BufferedOutputStream**: This class wraps around an `OutputStream` and provides buffering. It collects data in a buffer and writes it to the disk in larger chunks, reducing the number of write operations.
   - **BufferedReader**: This class wraps around a `Reader` and provides buffering for reading character streams.
   - **BufferedWriter**: This class wraps around a `Writer` and provides buffering for writing character streams.

3. **Efficiency**:

   - **Reduced I/O Operations**: By buffering data, fewer read/write operations are needed, which improves performance, especially in systems with high latency I/O devices like disk drives.
   - **Performance Improvement**: Buffering can significantly improve the performance of I/O operations by minimizing the interaction with the underlying hardware.

4. **Buffer Size**:
   - **Default Buffer Size**: Java provides a default buffer size, but it can be customized depending on the specific needs of the application. A larger buffer size can further reduce I/O operations, while a smaller buffer might be more appropriate for memory-constrained environments.

### Code Example

#### BufferedInputStream and BufferedOutputStream Example

```java
import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.BufferedOutputStream;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedStreamExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("input.txt"));
             BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream("output.txt"))) {

            byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
            int bytesRead;

            // Reading from input file and writing to output file with buffering
            while ((bytesRead = bis.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                bos.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

#### BufferedReader and BufferedWriter Example

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class BufferedCharStreamExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("input.txt"));
             BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {

            String line;

            // Reading from input file and writing to output file with buffering
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                bw.write(line);
                bw.newLine();
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Advantages of Buffering

- Improved Performance: Reduces the number of I/O operations, leading to better performance.
- Efficient Memory Use: By customizing the buffer size, you can manage memory usage effectively.
- Flexibility: Can be applied to both byte streams and character streams.

### Disadvantages of Buffering

- Increased Complexity: Requires understanding of buffering concepts and when to use them.
- Potential Delays: Data may be delayed in the buffer and not immediately written to the output until the buffer is full or explicitly flushed.

### Use Cases

- Large File Processing: Buffering is particularly useful when reading or writing large files, where direct I/O operations could be slow and inefficient.
- Network Communication: Buffering helps in reducing the number of network calls by batching data.
- Logging: Buffered writers are often used in logging frameworks to improve the performance of log writing.

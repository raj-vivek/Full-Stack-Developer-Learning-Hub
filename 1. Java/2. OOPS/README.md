# OOPS

## Theory

1. **Access Modifier**:

   1. public:
      Accessible in all classes in your application.

   2. protected:
      Accessible within the package in which it is defined and, in its subclass(es) (including subclasses declared outside the package).

   3. private:
      Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.

   4. default:
      (declared/defined without using any modifier): The class, method, or variable is accessible only within other classes in the same package.

2. Java is not a Pure Object-Oriented Language because it has Primitive Data Type.

3. **Java Naming conventions**:

   1. Class: A noun with first letter capital.
   2. Interface: An adjective like: Runnable, Serializable, etc. Try to use ‘able’ at the end.
   3. Methods: A verb.
   4. Constants: Like PI, MAX_INT, MIN_INT, etc.

4. **3 types of Constructors**:

   1. Default Constructor: A constructor that has no parameters
   2. Parameterized Constructor
   3. Copy Constructor

5. **Pillars of OOPs**:
   1. Abstraction
   2. Encapsulation
   3. Inheritance
   4. Polymorphism
      • Compile-time polymorphism
      • Runtime polymorphism

# Set and WeakSet in JavaScript

## Introduction

In JavaScript, **Set** and **WeakSet** are part of the **Keyed Collections** that allow developers to store collections of values. Unlike arrays, these collections are unique in that they store only distinct values and are optimized for fast operations like checking the existence of an element or adding/removing values. `Set` and `WeakSet` differ in their structure and use cases, especially concerning memory management and the types of values they store.

- **Set**: Stores unique values of any type and provides methods for iterating and manipulating the set.
- **WeakSet**: Stores weakly-held objects and provides better memory management by allowing garbage collection when the objects are no longer referenced.

## Set

### Theory

A **Set** is a collection of unique values. It allows you to store any type of value, including primitives and object references, but does not allow duplicate values. Sets are useful when you need to ensure that there are no duplicates in your collection and provide optimized performance for operations like checking membership.

### Key Concepts

1. **Unique Values**: Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values. If you attempt to add the same value twice, it will not be stored again.
2. **Order of Insertion**: Elements are iterated over in the order of insertion, but unlike arrays, the order does not matter when adding or removing elements.
3. **Iterability**: Like Maps, Sets are iterable, meaning you can loop over the values using `forEach()` or `for...of`.

### Important Methods and Properties

1. **`size`**: Returns the number of values in the Set.

   ```javascript
   console.log(set.size); // Output: 1
   ```

2. **`add(value)`**: Adds a new value to the Set. If the value already exists, it will not be added again.

   ```javascript
   const set = new Set();
   set.add(1);
   set.add(2);
   set.add(1); // Duplicate value, ignored
   console.log(set); // Output: Set { 1, 2 }
   ```

3. **`delete(value)`**: Removes a value from the Set, if it exists, and returns true if successful.

   ```javascript
   set.delete(2);
   console.log(set); // Output: Set { 1 }
   ```

4. **`has(value)`**: Checks if a value exists in the Set, returning true if it does, false otherwise.

   ```javascript
   console.log(set.has(1)); // Output: true
   console.log(set.has(3)); // Output: false
   ```

5. **`clear()`**: Removes all values from the Set.

   ```javascript
   set.clear();
   console.log(set.size); // Output: 0
   ```

6. **`forEach(callback)`**: Executes a provided function once for each value in the Set, in insertion order.

   ```javascript
   set.add(1).add(2);
   set.forEach((value) => console.log(value));
   // Output:
   // 1
   // 2
   ```

7. **`values()`**: Returns an iterator over the values in the Set. The keys() method is an alias for values() as sets don't have keys.

   ```javascript
   for (let value of set.values()) {
     console.log(value);
   }
   ```

8. **`entries()`**: Returns an iterator with [value, value] pairs for each value in the Set. This method is included to keep consistency with Maps, but the key and value are the same in Sets.

   ```javascript
   for (let entry of set.entries()) {
     console.log(entry);
   }
   // Output: [1, 1], [2, 2]
   ```

### Code Examples

1. Creating and Using a Set

   ```javascript
   const uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]);
   console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }

   // Adding values
   uniqueNumbers.add(6);
   uniqueNumbers.add(3); // 3 is already present, so it's ignored

   // Checking for a value
   console.log(uniqueNumbers.has(4)); // Output: true

   // Deleting a value
   uniqueNumbers.delete(5);
   console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Output: Set { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 }

   // Iterating over a Set
   uniqueNumbers.forEach((value) => {
     console.log(value);
   });
   // Output:
   // 1
   // 2
   // 3
   // 4
   // 6
   ```

2. Converting Set to Array

   - You can convert a Set to an Array by using the spread operator or Array.from():

   ```javascript
   const numbersArray = [...uniqueNumbers];
   console.log(numbersArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
   ```

### Use Cases

1. **Unique Data Storage**: Sets are ideal for storing collections of unique values, such as a list of unique user IDs or items in a shopping cart where duplicates are not allowed.
2. **Fast Lookups**: Since Set provides O(1) complexity for adding and checking values, it’s useful for cases where performance is critical, like checking membership.
3. **De-duplicating Arrays**: Sets can be used to quickly remove duplicate values from an array.

## WeakSet

### Theory

A **WeakSet** is a collection of objects that are weakly referenced. Like a **Set**, a **WeakSet** only stores unique values, but it can only store objects (no primitives), and the references to the objects are weak. This means that if no other reference to an object in the **WeakSet** exists, the object can be garbage-collected, freeing up memory.

### Key Concepts

1. **Object Keys Only**: WeakSets can only store objects, unlike Sets which can store any type of value.
2. **Weak References**: The references to objects in a WeakSet are weak, meaning if there are no other references to an object, it can be garbage-collected.
3. **Non-iterable**: WeakSets cannot be iterated over because the objects stored in a WeakSet may be garbage-collected at any time, so there’s no reliable way to iterate over the collection.

### Important Methods

1. `add(object)`: Adds an object to the WeakSet. The object must be of type Object, and the same object cannot be added twice.

```javascript
const ws = new WeakSet();
let obj1 = { name: "John" };
let obj2 = { name: "Jane" };

ws.add(obj1);
ws.add(obj2);
```

1. `has(object)`: Checks if an object is present in the WeakSet.

```javascript
console.log(ws.has(obj1)); // Output: true
console.log(ws.has({ name: "John" })); // Output: false (different object reference)
```

1. `delete(object)`: Removes an object from the WeakSet.

```javascript
ws.delete(obj2);
console.log(ws.has(obj2)); // Output: false
```

### Code Examples

1. Creating and Using a WeakSet

   ```javascript
   const ws = new WeakSet();
   let user1 = { name: "John" };
   let user2 = { name: "Jane" };

   // Adding objects to the WeakSet
   ws.add(user1);
   ws.add(user2);

   console.log(ws.has(user1)); // Output: true

   // If the object is no longer referenced, it will be garbage-collected
   user1 = null;
   console.log(ws.has(user1)); // Output: false
   ```

2. Automatic Garbage Collection

   - WeakSets automatically garbage-collect objects that no longer have references elsewhere in the program:

     ```javascript
     let car = { model: "Toyota" };
     const weakSet = new WeakSet();

     weakSet.add(car);

     // If the object reference is set to null, it will be garbage-collected
     car = null;
     ```

   - In this example, once the car object is set to `null`, it is eligible for garbage collection, and the `WeakSet` will no longer hold a reference to it.

### Use Cases

1. **Managing Object Metadata**: WeakSets are useful when you want to track objects without preventing them from being garbage-collected. For instance, they can be used in complex web applications to manage DOM element metadata without worrying about memory leaks.
1. **Memory-Sensitive Applications**: When working with large object graphs or complex data structures, WeakSets ensure that objects are garbage-collected when no longer needed, improving memory efficiency.

## Interview Questions

1. What is the difference between a Set and an Array in JavaScript?

   - A Set stores only unique values, whereas an array can store duplicate values. Sets also provide optimized performance for checking membership and eliminating duplicates.

1. When would you use a WeakSet instead of a Set?

   - WeakSets are used when you want to store objects without preventing them from being garbage-collected. This is particularly useful in memory-sensitive applications or when working with large object graphs.

1. Can you iterate over a WeakSet in JavaScript?

   - No, WeakSets are not iterable because their entries (objects) can be garbage-collected at any time, which would make iteration unreliable.

1. What are some common use cases for Sets in JavaScript?

   - Sets are useful for storing collections of unique values, removing duplicates from arrays, and efficiently checking for the existence of elements in a collection.

1. How does the add method in a WeakSet differ from the add method in a Set?

   - In a WeakSet, the add method can only add objects, and the object is weakly referenced (eligible for garbage collection). In a Set, the add method can add any type of value, including primitives, and the value is strongly referenced.

## Conclusion

Set and WeakSet are powerful tools for managing collections of unique values in JavaScript. Sets provide a general-purpose collection for storing any type of unique value, with methods for iteration and manipulation, making them ideal for scenarios where uniqueness is essential. WeakSets, on the other hand, are specialized collections that only store objects and allow for automatic garbage collection, making them ideal for memory-efficient applications. Understanding their differences and use cases is critical for writing optimized and effective JavaScript code.
